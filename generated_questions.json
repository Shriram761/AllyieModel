      "question": "An organization utilizes AWS VPCs to host several application tiers.  A newly deployed microservice consistently exhibits high latency, despite being located within the same VPC and having a direct route to the database. Initial troubleshooting reveals that the service's Elastic IP address is associated with an outdated security group rule allowing unrestricted ingress traffic from the public internet.  Considering best practices for minimizing attack surface and performance degradation, which of the following actions would MOST effectively mitigate this latency issue, *assuming no changes to the application code itself*?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Immediately modify the Elastic IP address to a new, unused one, regardless of existing security group configurations.",
        "B": "Update the security group associated with the Elastic IP address to explicitly deny all ingress traffic from the public internet, while maintaining outbound access for the microservice.",
        "C": "Implement a Network Address Translation (NAT) Gateway within the VPC to route all traffic to the microservice through a single, heavily monitored egress point.",
        "D": "Temporarily disable all outbound traffic rules within the microservice's security group to isolate the network and facilitate a deeper diagnostic investigation."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The outdated security group rule allows unauthorized external traffic, contributing to latency. Option B directly addresses this by restricting ingress, thereby minimizing potential attack vectors and resolving the core performance problem. Option A is problematic as it can disrupt services. Option C introduces complexity and may not isolate the issue. Option D could severely impact service functionality."

      "question": "An administrator is designing a highly available application architecture within an AWS VPC. The application requires seamless failover between two Availability Zones (AZs) and strict network isolation to prevent unauthorized access. Which of the following configurations BEST achieves this while minimizing operational overhead?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Employing a single public subnet with a Route 53 weighted routing policy directing traffic to both AZs and utilizing Network Address Translation (NAT) Gateways for outbound internet access.",
        "B": "Creating separate public and private subnets in each AZ, utilizing an Application Load Balancer (ALB) configured with health checks and a Network ACL (NACL) that allows ingress only from the ALB\u2019s CIDR block to both subnets.",
        "C": "Establishing a single Transit Gateway connected to each AZ\u2019s VPC, implementing a Global Accelerator and employing a Single-IP Address Multi-Availability Zone (SIA-MAZ) architecture with a NAT Gateway.",
        "D": "Using a single VPC spanning all three AZs, configuring a Public DNS with forwarding and implementing a Single NAT Gateway for all outbound traffic, relying solely on the VPC\u2019s route table."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Option B provides the most robust solution. It leverages separate public/private subnet segmentation for isolation, an ALB for health-based failover, and a NACL to restrict ingress traffic to the ALB's CIDR, ensuring only legitimate traffic is permitted. Options A lacks isolation, C introduces unnecessary complexity, and D doesn\u2019t address the core requirements of high availability and network isolation."
