      "question": "Which of the following scenarios would result in an error when attempting to create a route table with AWS VPC?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Creating a default route table for a public subnet.",
        "B": "Associating a public route table with an internet gateway.",

        "D": "Using a custom route to point to a private subnet in a different region."
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Creating a default route table for a public subnet would violate VPC best practices as it automatically directs all traffic from the internet gateway to the default route table, which should be used only for internal routing within the same subnet."
